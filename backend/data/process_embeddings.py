"""
Embedding Pre-computation Script

Pre-compute and cache embeddings for drugs and proteins to speed up predictions.

Usage:
    python data/process_embeddings.py

TODO: YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS! (V2 feature)

This script should:
1. Load all drugs from database
2. Generate fingerprints/embeddings for each drug
3. Store in vector database (pgvector, Pinecone, etc.)
4. Load proteins and generate embeddings
5. Store protein embeddings

Benefits:
- Faster search (pre-computed embeddings)
- Can use vector similarity search
- Reduces API latency
